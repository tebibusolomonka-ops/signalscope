# SignalScope

SignalScope is a media intelligence and research platform. The plan is to collect
content from sources such as articles, websites, RSS feeds, documents, audio and
video, and turn it into structured information that can be searched and analyzed.

## Status

Early development. Only the project foundation exists so far. There are no
user-facing features yet.

## Development

SignalScope needs Python 3.12 or newer.

Set up a virtual environment and install the package with the dev tools:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Settings come from `SIGNALSCOPE_*` environment variables. See
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Run the API locally. SignalScope logs each request itself, so the Uvicorn
access log is turned off:

```bash
uvicorn signalscope.api.app:create_app --factory --reload --no-access-log
```

Start the local PostgreSQL database and point SignalScope at it. The user,
password and database name in `compose.yaml` are all `signalscope`. They are
for local development only, so do not use them anywhere else.

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
export SIGNALSCOPE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://signalscope:signalscope@localhost:5432/signalscope
```

Stop it with `docker compose down`. Add `-v` to delete the data as well.

Apply database migrations. This needs `SIGNALSCOPE_DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Create a new migration:

```bash
alembic revision -m "Describe the change"
```

Run the checks:

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy src
```

## Docker

Build and run the API image:

```bash
docker build -t signalscope .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 signalscope
```

Pass settings as environment variables, for example
`-e SIGNALSCOPE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`. The same image can run migrations:

```bash
docker run --rm -e SIGNALSCOPE_DATABASE_URL=... signalscope alembic upgrade head
```
